This document contains the authors responses to the second referee's report for ApJL submission LET26384. The author's
concern has been addressed by including a sentence in the Discussion section referring to Yu et al. 2010.  Detailed
responses to the referee's comments follow below.

1. The authors may want to comment on Yu et al 2010, ApJ, 712, 198 that demonstrates the effects on migration of the Li
et al instabilities cited by the authors. Some of these results somewhat resemble the results of this paper.

Added "The migration is neither a random walk nor monotonic but has a chaotic character due to nonlinear interactions,
similar to the erratic migration seen in planet/disk simulations with Rossby vortex instabilities \citep{yu2010}."
